# RSA-encryption-algorithm
This is a RSA encryption algorithm I created for fun.
This program generates public and private keys, uses the public key to encrypt a string, and uses public and private keys to decrypt an encypted string. It is a 4096 bit RSA algorithm. 

For it to work correctly, open the entire file as a project.
First, run the RSA_Driver.java file to test the algorithm.
Second, enter "1" to generate keys, they only need to be generated once.
Third, enter "2" and then enter a message to encrypt.
Fourth. enter "3" to decrypt the encrypted message.
Enter "q" anytime to quit.
